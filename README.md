### Description 
Custom-Weather-FE(Under the Weather) is a React app built over two weeks by backend students at Turing School of Software and Design. Our goal was to create a weather app that does more than give you just the temperatures, but makes suggestions on music, movies, books, and activities to participate in, all based on the weather. 

If you'd like to checkout the frontend React application, it can be found at https://github.com/Custom-Weather/Custom-Weather-BE
